# OpenRogue

The inspiration for this project comes from Rogue, a classic fantasy game designed to run on **UNIX†** systems. <br/>
Known for its procedurally generated dungeons and challenging gameplay, *Rogue* has inspired an entire genre known as *roguelikes*. <br/>
This project is developed in Java and aims to recreate the spirit of *Rogue* while adding modern touches to it.
